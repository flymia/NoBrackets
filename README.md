A little bukkit plugin for small minecraft servers.

Functionallity: It changes the format of the messages sent on a bukkit server. It removes the brackets. For an example view my bukkit page. http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/nobrackets/

It is made for very small minecraft servers with no permissions system.
